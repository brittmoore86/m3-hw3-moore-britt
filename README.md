Still acclimating to using Bootstrap and Less. I had problems with getting items to stack appropritately in different viewport sizes as well as getting them centered. Could not figure out how to apply color overlay to the banner image, so I had to edit that in Photoshop.

Utilized lesscss.org and w3schools.com as well as this YouTube link for installing node: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD7u3YpMFp0
